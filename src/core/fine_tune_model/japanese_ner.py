# todo:
#  1) find a model according to the needs (find out more on what do we actually need,
#   what type of data we're about to work with);
#  2) train (supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement leaning (?)) model using train set collected;
#  3) collect confusion matrix and gradient descent results to enhance out model in future.
